NOTE ABOUT THE FLAGS:
You may see both the Bisexual and Lesbian flags on my profile picture. This is not because I identify as both at the same time, but because I‚Äôm currently questioning my sexuality and trying to figure out which label feels right for me. Having both flags simply represents where I am in my journey and shows the possibilities I‚Äôm considering, not a contradiction.

(Next time, don't remain Anonymous if you want to be an asswipe, you should have just kindly asked me about why I had both flags on my profile picture first, & I would've clarified things for you. Yes, I will admit I didn't have the clarification posted before your comment was made, but it still doesn't make it acceptable. PLEASE READ MY PRONOUNS PAGE BEFORE THINKING ABOUT SAYING SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THIS.)

(Thank you for presenting your name, Stacy! I appreciate being able to call you out properly for both comments.)

(Me & The Gang, We're Such Dorks)


Hello, it's nice to meet you. I know you'll most likely not read all of the links I put out, and that's fine, while it would be appreciated it isn't really a big deal. So I'm just going to put some basic information about me here for your convenience.
You can just call me Charles, I frequently play Pony Town in my free time, it's very relaxing. Before you interact, PLEASE know that I am an adult who prefers the Safe Server due to the abundant use of slurs and sexual talk in the 18+ Server. 
Because of this, I ask that you at LEAST be 16 before interacting with me, I take this VERY seriously. You may learn more about me by reading my Pronouns Page & StrawPage, I also allow C+H at any time, unless said otherwise. Stay safe out there! (NOTE: I BLOCK AND HIDE FREELY)

Frequently Used Cosplays (PLEASE DO NOT COPY THESE, ANYONE FOUND USING MY COSPLAYS WILL BE IMMEDIATELY BLOCKED. ALL MY PONIES WILL HAVE EITHER MY GITHUB OR PATREON LINKED. You may find my other cosplays on my StrawPage!):
